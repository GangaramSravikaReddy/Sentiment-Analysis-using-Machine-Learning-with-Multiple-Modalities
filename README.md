Sentiment analysis has evolved significantly with the rise of digital communication, where textual content alone often fails to capture the full spectrum of user emotions. This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis by incorporating multiple modalities—text, images, and audio—using advanced machine learning techniques. Our framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process visual data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyse textual information, and specialized RNNs with attention mechanisms for audio signals. By combining these diverse data sources, our approach offers a more nuanced understanding of sentiment, addressing the limitations of traditional unimodal methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multimodal model through comprehensive experiments on a diverse dataset of social media posts, product reviews, and multimedia content, achieving notable improvements in sentiment classification accuracy. This approach not only enhances the depth of sentiment analysis but also paves the way for future advancements in affective computing, providing richer insights into user emotions and opinions across various digital platforms.
